# CSharpConsole-ProjectDBSMgtSystem
A college project whilst on my Higher Diploma in Science in Computing course (2016/17).  The college project is a basic proof of concept project on console for a student management system through C# and .Net. The console program is persistent but as a proof of concept application does not use a relational database. Instead persistence is achieved through the use of lists and file read/writes.

The application has a basic console menu with add Student, add Lecturer, search Student and Lecturer, display all Student information and display only Lecturer first and last name along with an exit option.
